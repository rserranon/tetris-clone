## iInstall ncurses library:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncursesi

https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/

I used homebrew on Mac: `brew install ncurses`

## Complile your program specifying the use of c++17 and the ncurses library:

`clang++ -std=c++17 -fdiagnostics-color=always -g /Users/robert/development/c++/tetris/tetris.cpp -o /Users/robert/development/c++/tetris/tetris -lncurses`

Hope you like it.
